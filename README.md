# Encryptix-ML-Internship

An Online internship program that helped me to boost my knowledge in Machine Learning Concepts. I mainly performed 3 tasks that are shown below:

1. Movie Genre Classification: Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.

2. Customer Churn Predixtion: Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription based service or business. Use historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn.

3. Spam SMS Detection: Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with
classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify spam messages. [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
